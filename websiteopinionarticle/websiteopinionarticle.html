        <h2><b>The worst website:<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net"> Fanfiction</a></b></h2>
        
        <p>This website is one of the worst looking websites I've ever seen and used. I'm a big reader so I still use it, but there are A LOT of issues with the website. First off, the colors and layout look like it should be seen only in the early 2000's or late 1990's.I have been using this website since Freshman year of high school and the layout has not changed once. Second, the font and text are tiny. They also were not formatted to float with the screen. This makes reading the strories all the more difficult.The links along the navigation bar look as if I created them, which is not saying a lot. Navigating the website can also become very confusing if you are looking for something specific. I read a story a couple years back and don't remember the exact name of said story. So, I have tried to use the Search bar to look through the different stories and find it again. I have had no such luck. The search bar only looks for specific words from certain stories. Therefore, it can be very difficult to narrow down your options. Furthermore, since new stories are added every 10 minutes, searching for an individual story can prove to be near impossible if it had been published years ago. </p>
        
        <p>
           For the most part, the code looks normal. There are html 5 elements such as div, header, body, title, and links.There is an "error" warning though. When clicked, this warning proclaims "failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ( )". I have no clue what this means. Perhaps it is normal? 
            
            <p>Another important part to take note of is the ugly font that is used. It is the same font used in Brackets and it just does not help the website look professional. As said before, the text is also incredibly small. It doesn't appear that the creator of the website used a page wrap, which would have really helped. It would have also helped if different background colors were used as well as different profile pictures. The color right now used is a navy blue for links and navigation and than a cream-white for the background. Each author also has a profile picture. The pictures look like they could be seen and used in a very old computer game. It would help if the outlines to these images were not so blocky. It's a simple website, but it would definitely help if any and all blocky looking text and images were smoothed over. That would help it look  more modern.

        <h2> A good website:<a href="https://www.lulus.com"> Lulus</a> </h2>

        <p> Lulus is a clothing line I used to get my Prom and Twirp dresses. It is also a great site to purchase additional cute clothes such as jeans, tops and shoes.I have used this all through highschool and college and have not been disappointed. From what I have been able to tell, the creators of the website have updated the webpage in order to help it appear modern. The navigation bar is easy to navigate. When shrinking and expanding the webpage, the logo of "Lulus" remains in the center with the navigation bar expanding with it or shrinking into a "waffle" bar. The search bar is also easy to use. You can use specific words or broad terms in order to find what you might be looking for. Since clothing is seasonal, it would make sense for the website to follow this and change it's look each season. Their spring season "look" is that of light pinks and whites. There's also nice font spacing that allows for the webpages to look more modern</p>
            <p>
            The layout of the website makes sense. The home page is dedicated to helping the user navigate between tops, denim, etc. Below this are different advertisments put together through column elements. There are also invitations for the user to read the blog while giving more details towards their instagram page. When looking through their clothing pages, there are images of models that fill the screen. When the website fills the whole screen, there are a total of 4 models that fill each row. To the left of the models is another column that allows the user to sort through what specific color, size, or article of clothing is desired. Each image is linked. They also change when the curser passes over them. This allows the user to see the models in different poses while wearing a specific piece of clothing. </p>

                The code is by far more detailed than the first website I reviewed (fanfiction). It appears way more organized. For expample, the attribute and elements are not listed in a direct line. HTML 5 elements are used.An element I see that I did not see throughout the other website is the button element.There are also multiple "sript" elements. The one issue I have with the coding is that there appears to be 109 error messages. Each error discusses a difficulty in loading certain data. Is this bad or good? I have no clue.
            </p>
    
        <h2> A good website: <a href="https://www.espn.com"> ESPN</a> </h2> 
        
        <p>ESPN was one of the first websites you showed us. I really like how easy it is to navigate throughout the different pages. The main home page contains mainly the most recent breaking news in sports. Along the top, above the navigation bar, you can easily find constant updated information. For example, right now the website is covering how coronavirus is affecting the public in the sporting world. The set up of the main page has what appears to be a page wrap. So All of the recent and most important news articles are found in the middle. On the right and left are two different columns. The left column is filled with "quick links" ans well as links to additionally ESPN websites and social media links. The right column contains top headlines, ESPN advertisements, and trending videos. </p>
            <p>
                I am also a big fan of the images and colors used for the website. In the main section of the main page, each of the images have rounded colors that give the website a more modern look. The main color of ESPN is the color red. However, I like how the creators of the website used little hints of red and orange while keep the main color as a simple white. I also like how they styled and colored the font. In the right column, the headlines of the videos are bolded. The text below this is greyed which gives a nice contrast. Additionally, the spacing of the text also helps the webpage look nice and modern.
            </p>

                The coding is surprisingly not nearly as complicated as Lulus coding. Perhaps this is because the Lulus website involves a lot of interaction with the user? HTML 5 elements are used. It is also sectioned off successfully. However, there are a total of 21 error alerts that proclaim a failure while loading data. I'm a little confused because the worst website only had one error whereas the best websites have quite a bit. Another issue I have with the website is that the homepage is very long. The left and right column's run out of information way before the main part of the page does. If I had to give the creators a critique, I would tell them to avoid putting too much information on the first section of the page. Otherwise, it's just information overload.
