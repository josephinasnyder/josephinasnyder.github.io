        Review of State Websites
    </h1>
    <h2>
        <oli><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">State Vermont (Favorite) </a></oli>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <li>This website was the best when talking about it's aesthetic</li>
        <li> The search bar on the top and center with a beautiful picture of Vermont's fall following beneath it is inviting to the viewer. </li>
        <li> The maneuverability is fantastic in comparison to the other websites</li>
        <li> The load time was quick when shifting between the different links and options listed throughout the menu.</li>
        <li> The website fits my computer screen fairly well. </li>
        <p> This website is definitely the best when compared to the other four. I especially love how they did not put too much information on the home page like other websites. It is very easy to navigate through and the picture are very much inviting. I've been to the East Coast but never Vermont, maybe I need to look into it during my next trip!</p>

        <oli><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">State Tennesse </a></oli>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <li>The colors are a bit dark. However, I believe that this works for the website. It almost makes it appear more professional</li>
        <li> This website was quick to load however Vermont's and Alaska's were a bit faster. </li>
        <li> The links were easy to spot due to good pictures and bold lables. This made it easy to navigate between pages  </li>
        <li> The website stretches with my computer screen and phone. Very satisfying</li>
        <p> This website probably was not a lot of peoples favorites but I liked how professional it looked. The main page was not too crowded and it was not difficult to look through the different pages when searching for something specific. It could improve, however, on it's load time which was either average of below average at times.</p>

    <h2>
        <h3>
        <oli><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">State Iowa</a></oli>
        <li> The home page is incredibly busy and a little unsatisfying. </li>
        <li> The website, for the most part, had a more modern appeal to it. However, it definitely lacks certain qualities. </li>
        <li> The home page is set up in more of a listed format which makes the page long. </li>
        <li> The load time was pretty average.</li>
        <li> I did enjoy the quick links listed at the top of the page. This made it slightly easier to naviagate.</li>
        <li> When clicking and looking through the other links, I was surprised to see that other pages (such as their "travel page") were more aesthetically pleasing than the home page.</li>
        <p> Overall, this website leaves a lot to be desired. However, due to it's more modernistic appearance as well as it's aesthetically pleasing additional pages, I decided that it would fit in the 3rd spot following Tennesse. It also had an average load time. The home page should be further improved upon. Perhaps different colors would help to revert it from looking dull to looking interesting!</p>

    <h2>
        <oli><a href="https://alaska.gov">State Alaska</a></oli>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <li>There's a lot of controlled chaos on this website but still navigable</li>
        <li> The color scheme could be furthur improved upon however it's pleasing how it follows the State's colors </li>
        <li> The speed of the website was good. It was pretty quick when asked to load new pages</li>
        <li> I liked the drop down menus that popped up when the curser sped over the top. If not easy, than manageable to navigate</li>
        <p> There's definitely a certain aesethic about this website. However, it is not my favorite. I would rank it a 4. There's a lot I did not know about Alask but this website was informative and consumer friendly upon investigation. However, it could be further improved upon if updated to look more modern.</p>

        <oli><a href="https://www.ok.gov/portal/section.php?sec_id=1">State Oklahoma (Least Favorite) </a></oli>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <li>The aesthetic of this website is definitely the worst out of all 5 websites.</li>
        <li> The color are dull and not inviting. The first picture to greet the viewer is a boring field of grass which does not help.</li>
        <li> The speed of the website was actually pretty good and actually surprising</li>
        <li> There's hardly any information on the home page. The information that is present is hard to locate and find.</li>
        <li> The drop down menus are formatted fairly well. However, it would help if the font was bigger.</li>
        <p> This websites lacks any excitement and is not entirely inviting. The information that is given is difficult to find. However, I do find it interesting how the website really pushes for social media exposure. Perhaps those social media sights are formatted better than the initial website.</p>
