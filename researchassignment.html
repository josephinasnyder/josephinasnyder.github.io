        <h2>The Best Option: <a href= "https://www.godaddy.com" > Go Daddy</a></h2>
        <p>The Go Daddy site is the best due to the fact that the level of infomation and support is much higher when comparing the other two web hosting services. There are multiple options in regards to domain names which also appear to be much less expensive in comparison to the other services. This hosting service is also considered to be or boasts of being the world's largest registrar. My second option would be the Blue Host web host with the third being the Fat Cow web host. This is due to the fact that both do not offer as many options in regards to the domain names and do not seem to engage nearly as much with their users.</p>
